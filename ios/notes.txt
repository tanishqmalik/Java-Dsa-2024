different types of access modifiers

1.public :- anywhere access
2.private :- only in that class related to 
3. protected :- only to its  class and sub classes
4. default:- if user didn't modify any modifier that its default 

static: -which creates and destroyes only on in a program 

void: - returns a data type

java has two main ways to define a reusable code in a program those are method and functions

methods and function allow users to encapsulate the data and return output as specific logic

method part of a class 


error is recoverable component at any particular point of time 
types of error which the technology going to recover are 
1. compile time error :-error occur at the time of program
3. runtime occur :- at the time of excecuting of performing


javac is not an internal or external command line ;- java is not installed or not compiled succesfully

exception:- it is a irecoverable component which cannot be recovered at any particular point of time
types of exception
1 checked
2. unchecked

the process of handling an exception is known as exception handling 
exceptions are handed using the two blogs:- try block and catch block 

advantages:- different operation can be defined and can be supported ....arrays are used for easy indexing because its starts the value from zero while allocating 
the aray 

using the arrays.. the sufficient array can be managed and stored the main disadvantage of using an aaray is the size of an array is fixed


if the size exceeds the value then it can result in a boundary 
it is very difficult in the arrays to manage large dataset

the array size is fixed and user cannot change its length in static allocation while in dynamic allocation the sets its length as per the 

abstarction :- it is the process of hiding unneeccsory info ... it is nothing but partially implemented and partially unimplemneted in the program

abstarct class can be sub class .. in the program 


// access modifiers in java 
private 
protected
public
default


public:- the class which is accessable inside the program for all the classes is known public
the class which is accessable. it is used while developing api's, interfaces where the external code should be accessable to the part of the program

protected:- a class which can accessable to its class and subclasses inside that package is protected

if a programmer or user has not specified any access modifier or method in a program then the jvm itself takes default access modifier as package


a constructor with multiple constructor with programs with in the same class is known as overloading constructor 
in overloading constructor users will have multiple constructor , compiler chooses the right constructor based on teh arguments passed
to execute the program

constructors are initialized with a new keyword and constructor is involked automatically in program.. when there is no constructor declared and constructor are set to initialized the values as parameter 
advantages of using constructors:- 

constructors are used to initialized the objects so that the core will be flexible, easy to understand, maintainable , constructors are flexible because it allows a user to initialize the object in different ways
constructor are consistent because they ensure the values to be correct
